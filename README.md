# Excited_state_solver
This program is an improved version of the earlier GitHub program 'meanstate', and can also calculate approximations for the wave functions and energy eigenvalues of 2D quantum systems.

The application can find an approximation for an excited state wave function without sequencial computation of the lower energy states beginning from ground state.
The source code files are compiled in Linux terminal as in (for the 2d rectangle example)

g++ -O3 -ffast-math rectangle.cpp
